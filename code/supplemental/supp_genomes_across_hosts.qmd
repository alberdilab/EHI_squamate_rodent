## How are bacterial genomes distributed across hosts?

```{r}

cdb <- read_delim("../../data/DMB0173_Cdb.csv.gz")
#contains high level clustering information for MAGs
ndb <- read_delim("../../data/DMB0173_Ndb.csv.gz")
#contains pairwise ANI distances (fastANI) between clusters of MAGs

#filter out only genomes that have secondary clusters (MASH ANI > 90%)
cdb_counts <- cdb %>%
  add_count(primary_cluster, name = "n_primary_cluster_members") %>%
  add_count(secondary_cluster, name = "n_secondary_cluster_members")

cdb_filt <- cdb_counts %>%
  filter(n_primary_cluster_members > 1) %>%
  mutate(genome = str_replace(genome, '.fa.gz', ''))

#basic stats
n_primary_clusters <- length(unique(cdb$primary_cluster))
n_secondary_clusters <- length(unique(cdb$secondary_cluster))


#Also filter for ANI > 95% in Ndb??
max_extra <- read_delim("../../data/mag_extra_metadata.csv.gz") %>%
  mutate(mag_name = str_replace(mag_name, ".fa", ""))

mag_info <- read_delim("../../data/DMB0173_mag_info.tsv.gz") %>%
  inner_join(., cdb_filt, by = join_by(genome)) %>%
  left_join(., max_extra, by = join_by(genome == mag_name))

## Pull data from AirTable
#Select the right view id
# view <- airtable(base = 'appWbHBNLE6iAsMRV',
#                  table = 'tblMzd3oyaJhdeQcs',
#                  view = 'viwMD6lnM4YFxkAmi')
# 
# #download mag info from AirTable (takes a while, so do once)
#  airtable_data_mag <- read_airtable(view,
#                                     id_to_col = TRUE,
#                                     max_rows = 50000)

#Host species per cluster?

hosts_across_clusters <- mag_info %>%
  summarise(n_species_cluster = n_distinct(host_species),
            n_secondary_cluster_members = max(n_secondary_cluster_members),
            n_order_cluster = n_distinct(host_order),
            n_secondary_cluster = n_distinct(secondary_cluster),
            mean_genome_size = mean(mag_size),
            .by = secondary_cluster)

n_cross_class <- hosts_across_clusters %>%
  filter(n_order_cluster == 2) %>%
  nrow()

n_cross_species <- hosts_across_clusters %>% 
  filter(n_secondary_cluster_members > 1 & n_species_cluster > 1) %>% 
  nrow()
```

5123 MAGs were dereplicated down to `r n_secondary_clusters` at 98% ANI (average nucleotide identity). There were `r n_primary_clusters` clusters of MAGs that were \>90% similar based on MASH.

A total of `r n_cross_class` clusters contains MAGs \>98% ANI across host class (i.e. squamates and rodents), and for host species this is `r n_cross_species`. Keep in mind that these values are raw â€“ no evenness of coverage filtering, so will need to be validated. Regardless, there looks like there is sufficient comparisons here that we can explore when it comes to testing e.g. 'does ANI between bacterial genomes correlate with host phylogenetic distance?'.

Possible future questions:

> 1.  Does ANI between bacterial genomes correlate with host phylogenetic distance?
> 2.  MAG covariates that explain these cross-species clusters? (e.g. taxonomy, genome size, GC, specific functions)
> 3.  More of these clusters in squamates vs rodents? (though possibly biased by host phylogenetic distance?)
