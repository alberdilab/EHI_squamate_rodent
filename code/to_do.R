# genomes per species
# checkm2 by species
# then do alpha per species
# colour palette (phylogeny) -- warm/cold for mammals / reptiles
# group func phylo tree by gift level (elem2function)
# document files that are in .Rdata in the readme.md
# timetree in repo?
lab / geograph / sample metadata -> check outliers
host life history/diets -> make table (check database)
gifts -> community-weighted per species
Clusters of bact. genomes across host species (MASH / validate with mapping results)
