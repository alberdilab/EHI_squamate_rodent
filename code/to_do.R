lab / geograph / sample metadata -> check outliers
genomes per species
host life history/diets -> make table (check database)
gifts -> community-weighted per species
colour palette (phylogeny) -- warm/cold for mammals / reptiles
then do alpha per species
group func phylo tree by gift level (elem2function)
document files that are in .Rdata in the readme.md
timetree in repo?
checkm2 by species
MAP??
Clusters of bact. genomes across host species (MASH / validate with mapping results)
networks of functions/species
